# NaiveBayesClassiferFromScratch
- Implemented a Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch using Python to understand the underlying math and algorithmic workflow.
- Also implemented the same model using Scikit-learn's GaussianNB for comparison and validation.
- Designed and used a custom data generation module to create synthetic datasets based on various probability distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Uniform).
- Evaluated both models on the generated dataset to compare accuracy and behavior under controlled conditions.
